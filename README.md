# Orbit
Orbit is a demo that I am developing to test and demonstrate my [entity component system implementation](https://github.com/talhacali/ECS). It is a quite simple game with
multiple types of objects that orbit around light sources. Objects can be pushed out of their orbit by the player. The aim is to have many entities, components, systems and
to push the limits of performance of my implementation. 

The demo will have at least 4 different types of entities that rotate and components and systems for transform, rendering, movement, lifetime, and collision.
